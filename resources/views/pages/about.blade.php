    <p class="text-xs">I am a creative media artist whose creative practice includes interdisciplinary storytelling through photography, writing, audio and other relevant artistic mediums. My practice explores what it means to be human — our complex/simple/intersectional identities, the communities we exist in and how we take up space in the world. At the core of my artistic practice is identity, creativity, community and enjoyment. As someone who grew up in a very communal society being Nigerian, community continues to be the base of my existence even as as I move across the world and some of the things that are culturally and socially relevant or important to me in creating community or self expression are food, music and a good ol’ social gathering.</a>
